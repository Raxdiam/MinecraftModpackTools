# Minecraft Modpack Tools

MCMPT is a command-line tool designed to streamline the creation of modpacks using MultiMC or its forks (Prism Launcher, PolyMC, etc.). Additionally, it makes using an instance created by MultiMC as a git repository more sensible.

_This tool is a W.I.P. and the code is still quite messy. Use at your own risk._
